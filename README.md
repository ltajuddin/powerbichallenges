# Welcome to my project on visualising COVID-19 Cases around the World
### This project is one of the challenges by Enterprise DNA. In this project, we are trying to visualise COVID-19 Cases around the world by looking at the confirmed, recovered and deaths for each country. 
### The visualisation for this project is inspired by very esteemed individuals in the PowerBI community!

The Challenge: Businesses and livelihoods are trying to cope as best as they can with COIVD-19, so what is the current status of CV19 across the globe and for any selected country? Is it getting better, worse, do we need to take some action?

The key objectives are:

Connect to open-source data

Import and create a data model

Create a 1 page report of what the current situation is.

Based on the following information, I have created a one-page, high-level analysis of the important statistics to meet the above objectives.
